# Daily Math and Code Challenges

Welcome to my Daily Math and Code Challenges repository! üéâ

## About

I'm enagaing in daily mental exercises this 2025 to sharpen my skills in advanced math, physics, and coding(javascript). This repository will serve as a collection of the challenges I tackle each day. It's a great way for me to stay sharp, improve my problem-solving abilities, and ace school üíÉüèº.

## Structure

Every day, I'll add a new challenge to this repository. Each challenge will include a problem statement and my solution. Feel free to browse through them and try solving them yourself!

I will also post snapshots of my solutions on twitter (x) to find my kind and interact with them.

## Why I'm Doing This

- **Mental Exercise:** Keeping my mind active and engaged with daily challenges.
- **School Preparation:** Enhancing my understanding of advanced math and physics concepts.
- **Coding Skills:** Improving my coding and problem-solving abilities.

## Note
- My maths solutions will be written on paper and image added here (i love writing on paper sorryüò©)
